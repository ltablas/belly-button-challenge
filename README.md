# belly-button-challenge

This week's challenge uses d3 to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Instructions are to create:
    1. A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
    2. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
    3. Display the sample metadata, i.e. an individual's demographic information, as a key-value pair.

All plots are to be updated when a new selection is made via the Test Subject Id dropdown.

Note: Bonus was not attempted.

Final javascript code can be found in static folder, file "app.js".
